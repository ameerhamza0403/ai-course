# Chapter 1.10 – Cost Optimization & Scaling AI Systems

As an AI architect, it’s not enough to just build working AI solutions — they must be **efficient, scalable, and cost-effective**. This chapter focuses on strategies and tools that leading experts use to run AI in production without burning through budgets.

---

## 1.10.1 Why Cost Optimization Matters

- AI workloads (especially LLMs) are **resource-heavy**.
- Poor scaling design leads to **exploding cloud bills**.
- Smart optimization allows **smaller teams** to deliver enterprise-grade AI.

## 1.10.2 API Models vs. Open-Source Models

**Tradeoffs:**

- **API Models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI):**
  - Pros: No infra management, fast prototyping.
  - Cons: Ongoing costs scale with usage, limited customization.
- **Open-Source Models (e.g., LLaMA 3, Mistral, Falcon):**
  - Pros: Control, can fine-tune locally, lower long-term cost.
  - Cons: Upfront infra cost, more ops complexity.

## 1.10.3 Techniques for Cost Optimization

1. **Batching & Parallelism**

   - Group multiple requests before sending to model.
   - Reduces tokenization overhead and GPU idle time.

2. **Caching**

   - Cache embeddings and LLM responses for repeated queries.
   - Example: Use **Redis** or **Weaviate** with TTL.

3. **Quantization**

   - Run models in reduced precision (INT8/INT4).
   - Reduces GPU/CPU memory footprint with minimal accuracy loss.
   - Tool: [BitsAndBytes](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/quantization){:target="_blank"}

4. **Distillation**

   - Train smaller “student” models to mimic large ones.
   - Example: DistilBERT vs. BERT.

5. **Adaptive Routing**
   - Use smaller models for simple queries, escalate to larger ones only when needed.

## 1.10.4 Scaling Architectures

- **Autoscaling:** Spin up/down instances based on load.
- **Serverless Inference:** Run models on demand (AWS Lambda + GPU instances).
- **Vector Database Sharding:** Distribute embeddings across nodes for large-scale RAG.
- **Model Serving Platforms:**
  - [Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html){:target="_blank"}
  - [TorchServe](https://pytorch.org/serve/){:target="_blank"}
  - [Modal Labs](https://modal.com/){:target="_blank"}

**Case Study:**

- OpenAI’s own infra runs **tens of thousands of GPUs** but heavily relies on caching & routing to keep costs sustainable.

## 1.10.6 Practical Labs

1. **Lab 1 – Deploy a Quantized Model**

   - Use Hugging Face + `bitsandbytes` to load a 4-bit quantized LLaMA model.
   - Compare GPU/CPU usage vs. full precision.

2. **Lab 2 – Implement Request Caching**

   - Build a small RAG app with Redis caching for embeddings.
   - Measure cost reduction after caching repeat queries.

3. **Lab 3 – Autoscaling API Endpoint**
   - Deploy a FastAPI app serving an LLM via Docker.
   - Add Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler).
   - Stress test with 1000 concurrent requests.

## 1.10.7 Next Steps

- Study how **MLOps + FinOps** overlap.
- Learn **monitoring tools** (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog for inference latency + cost).
- Experiment with **hybrid infra** (API + self-hosted) to balance cost and speed.

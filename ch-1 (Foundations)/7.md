## 1.7.4 Why This Matters for You

As a fullstack developer moving towards **AI architecting**, these materials help you:

- Grasp the **theory** (papers) behind how LLMs and agents work.
- Stay aligned with **industry practitioners** through blogs and roadmaps.
- Develop an intuition for **architectural decisions**, like when to fine-tune vs. use APIs, or how to design agent workflows.

---

## ✅ Next Steps

- Read **at least 2 research papers** (start with _Attention is All You Need_ and _ReAct_).
- Follow **2 expert blogs** and subscribe to their updates (Lilian Weng + Simon Willison recommended).
- Bookmark and skim **Full Stack Deep Learning** as a living reference.

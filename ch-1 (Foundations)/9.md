# 1.9 Security, Privacy & Guardrails for AI Architecting

As LLM-powered agents gain agency—capable of reading, planning, or acting—**rigorous guardrails** become non-negotiable. This section gives you a practical, architect-level guide to securing your AI systems against emerging threats.

## 1.9.1 Why Guardrails Matter

- Guardrails protect against **prompt injection**, hallucinations, biased outputs, and data leakage.
- Without them, powerful AI agents can go off-rails—revealing private data, following malicious instructions, or generating harmful content.
- Recent high-profile incidents (e.g., Grok's indirect prompt injection) underscore how a failure in security can have real-world consequences.
- Guardrails are part of a **Defense-in-Depth** strategy: multilayered controls across prompts, pipelines, and runtime systems.

## 1.9.2 Common Guardrail Categories

### Input Sanitization

- Filter dangerous tokens or prompt patterns (e.g., “Ignore all previous instructions…”).
- Follow OWASP LLM countermeasures: regex filters, reputation checks, adversarial testing.

### Prompt Design

- Use **prompt hierarchies**: System → Developer → User → Retrieved content. Give system prompts highest trust.
- Avoid package hallucinations in code generation (rely on verified package lists).

### Output Validation

- Enforce structured outputs via **JSON schemas**. If validation fails, rerun with stricter prompt.
- Use LLM-as-judge to flag unsafe outputs (binary pass/fail) rather than free-form scoring.

### Layered Testing

- Red-team your prompt flow—simulate attacks. AWS encourages periodically testing with known patterns.

### Privacy-by-Design

- Apply GDPR principles: minimize data retention, avoid sensitive data in prompts, conduct privacy impact assessments.

### Architectural Controls

- Implement **guard agents** that vet inputs/outputs before passing to the main LLM.
- Use **Encrypted Prompt** schemes—embed permissions in encrypted form to safeguard unauthorized actions.
- Use **Polymorphic Prompts**—vary prompt structure dynamically to thwart pattern-based attacks.
- Use **Signed Prompts**—cryptographic signature verifies the origin of trusted instructions.

## 1.9.3 Practical Labs & Tools

### Lab 1: Input Guard

```python
def sanitize_input(text):
    blocked = ["ignore previous", "jailbreak", "secret instruction"]
    for phrase in blocked:
        if phrase in text.lower():
            return "[REDACTED]"
    return text
```

### Lab 2: Output Schema Enforcement

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "answer": { "type": "string" },
    "source": { "type": "string" },
    "confidence": { "type": "number" }
  },
  "required": ["answer", "source"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

### Lab 3: Prompt Compression (SecurityLingua)

- Explore the idea of **SecurityLingua**: compress prompts while revealing malicious intent to activate LLM guardrails.

### Lab 4: Defense via Prompt Variation

- Implement a simple **PromptTemplateRandomizer**: vary instruction phrasing randomly to make injection harder.

## 1.9.4 Architect’s Checklist & Best Practices

1. **Define prompt trust tiers**: system → developer → user → external content.
2. **Always sanitize inputs and validate outputs** via schemas.
3. Implement **human-in-loop or red-team testing** during design and periodically in prod.
4. Use privacy-preserving defaults (e.g., avoid logging sensitive data).
5. **Automate schema validation and audit logs** for traceability.
6. Use **dynamic prompt structures** or **signed/encrypted prompts** to strengthen defenses.
7. Monitor for anomalies—lag in outputs, unexpected tokens, hallucinations.
8. Keep guard logic versioned and aligned with incident response playbooks.

# Chapter 2.20 – Scalable Model Serving and Inference Optimization

## 2.20.1 Introduction

Deploying AI models at scale requires **efficient serving architectures** and **optimized inference** to handle high throughput and low-latency requirements. This chapter covers strategies for scaling models, optimizing compute, and ensuring reliability in production.

Key goals:

- Serve multiple models with **high availability**.
- Reduce **latency** for real-time applications.
- Optimize **hardware utilization** (CPU, GPU, TPU).
- Enable **multi-tenant serving** without conflicts.

## 2.20.2 Model Serving Architectures

1. **Single-Model Serving**

   - Simple API endpoints (REST/gRPC).
   - Suitable for low-volume or batch workloads.

2. **Multi-Model Serving**

   - Hosts multiple models on a single cluster.
   - Requires isolation and versioning strategies.

3. **Serverless AI Inference**

   - Scales automatically based on request load.
   - Pay-per-use model reduces operational costs.

4. **Edge Deployment**
   - Models deployed on-device (mobile, IoT).
   - Requires model compression and quantization.

## 2.20.3 Optimization Techniques

### 1. **Batching**

- Combine multiple inference requests into one batch for GPU/TPU.
- Reduces context-switching overhead and increases throughput.

### 2. **Model Quantization**

- Reduce precision of model weights (FP32 → FP16/INT8).
- Benefits: Faster inference, lower memory, minimal accuracy loss.

### 3. **Model Pruning**

- Remove redundant weights or neurons.
- Improves speed without significant accuracy drop.

### 4. **TensorRT / ONNX Runtime**

- Optimized runtime engines for deep learning models.
- Enable hardware-specific acceleration on GPUs/TPUs.

### 5. **Sharding & Horizontal Scaling**

- Split large models or dataset across multiple nodes.
- Useful for extremely large LLMs or vision models.

### 6. **Caching Predictions**

- Cache repeated predictions to reduce compute.
- Effective for recommender systems or NLP models with repeated queries.

- Document deployment architecture and rollback strategies for audits.

**Summary**

Scalable model serving and inference optimization are crucial for production AI systems. By applying techniques like batching, quantization, pruning, sharding, and leveraging optimized serving frameworks, organizations can achieve high throughput, low latency, and cost-efficient AI operations. Continuous monitoring and auto-scaling ensure models remain performant as usage scales.

## 2.26.2 Evaluation & Safety

1. **Unit Testing for Prompts / Agents**

   - Validate output formats, correctness, and expected content.
   - Automate regression testing across new model versions.

2. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**

   - Incorporate expert review for high-stakes or sensitive outputs.

3. **Red-Teaming & Adversarial Testing**

   - Simulate malicious prompts or edge-case scenarios.
   - Detect hallucinations, bias, and unsafe outputs.

4. **Privacy & Security**
   - Filter sensitive data (PII/PHI) before generating outputs.
   - Sandbox agent tool access.

## 2.26.3 Cost & Performance Engineering

1. **Token Accounting**

   - Track token usage for cost optimization.
   - Estimate API costs per workflow.

2. **Caching Strategies**

   - Cache repeated queries to reduce compute and latency.

3. **Speculative Decoding & Streaming**

   - Start returning tokens while generating remaining tokens.

4. **Model Choice & Scaling**

   - Smaller models for low-critical tasks, larger for high-quality outputs.
   - Batch multiple requests for efficiency.

5. **Server Runtime Optimization**
   - vLLM, GPU pooling, and asynchronous inference pipelines.

## 2.26.4 Platform Choices & Free-Tier Practice Tracks

**Local Development**

- Ollama / llama.cpp → offline experiments for small models.
- LangGraph → multi-agent orchestration locally.

**Hosted Notebooks**

- Google Colab Free → GPU available for experiments.
- Kaggle → Free GPU/CPU, reproducible notebooks.
- Hugging Face Spaces → Deploy demos with free CPU, optional paid GPU.

**Practice Recommendations**

- Combine LLM experimentation with RAG, MCP, and agent loops.
- Log, evaluate, and monitor outputs even on free-tier setups.
- Experiment with multiple memory management and retrieval strategies.

## 2.26.5 Real-World Lab Example

**Scenario:** Multi-agent knowledge assistant using free-tier tools.

1. Deploy small local model with **llama.cpp**.
2. Implement **MCP server** locally with Python Flask.
3. Store embeddings in **FAISS local index**.
4. Create retrieval + reasoning loop with **LangGraph**.
5. Evaluate outputs using **lm-eval-harness** or manual human-in-the-loop checks.
6. Track token usage and cache frequent queries.

Outcome: Hands-on experience simulating **production-like agentic AI systems** without any paid subscription.

This chapter equips the AI architect with:

- **Robust evaluation pipelines** to validate prompts, agents, and outputs.
- **Safety protocols** to handle hallucinations, bias, and security risks.
- **Cost & performance optimization techniques** for efficient deployment.
- **Free-tier platforms & labs** to gain practical, hands-on experience.

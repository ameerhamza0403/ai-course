# Chapter 2.24 – RAG Beyond the Basics (Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation Patterns)

## 2.24.1 Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by combining **retrieval from structured/unstructured sources** with generative capabilities. Advanced RAG patterns go beyond basic document retrieval, enabling **accurate, efficient, and context-rich responses**.

## 2.24.2 Indexing Strategies

1. **Chunking**

   - Split documents into semantically meaningful sections.
   - Avoid exceeding model context window.
   - Maintain links to original sources.

2. **Embedding-based Index**

   - Convert text chunks into vector embeddings.
   - Tools: FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone (free tiers).

3. **Hybrid Search**
   - Combine vector similarity + keyword search.
   - Improves recall for exact matches and semantic relevance.

## 2.24.3 Reranking Techniques

- Use a secondary model to **score retrieved documents** before feeding into LLM.
- Benefits: Reduces noise, increases relevance.
- Methods:
  - Cross-encoder scoring
  - BM25 + embedding similarity combination
  - Learned rerankers from labeled data

## 2.24.4 Adapters & Structured Outputs

1. **Adapters**

   - Lightweight fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks.
   - Avoid full model retraining; saves compute.

2. **Structured Outputs**
   - Ensure generated text follows expected schema (JSON, XML, tables).
   - Tools: function-calling APIs, prompt engineering templates.

---

## 2.24.5 Evaluation & Hardening

- Evaluate RAG system using:
  - Recall, precision, F1 metrics on retrieval
  - Response accuracy and faithfulness
  - Latency and cost metrics
- Hardening techniques:
  - Guardrails: restrict generation scope
  - Prompt templates with constraints
  - Monitor hallucinations with feedback loops

## 2.24.6 Practical Example: Customer Support Agent

**Scenario:**

- LLM assists customer service reps by answering queries from knowledge base.

**Workflow:**

1. Query arrives → Chunked KB documents retrieved via embedding similarity.
2. Hybrid search + reranking ensures top 5 most relevant documents.
3. LLM generates response with structured JSON output.
4. Logs, feedback, and context stored for next interaction.

**Tools Used:**

- FAISS / Chroma for embeddings
- Hugging Face Transformers for LLM
- LangChain or LangGraph orchestration

---

## 2.24.7 Best Practices

- Always maintain **links to original sources** for traceability.
- Prefer **hybrid retrieval** for sensitive or critical applications.
- Use **structured outputs** to integrate with downstream systems.
- Continuously evaluate and retrain rerankers with new data.
- Experiment with free tier embeddings & LLM APIs for practical learning.

### Summary

Advanced RAG patterns allow LLMs to **access large knowledge bases efficiently** while producing reliable and structured outputs. Techniques like hybrid search, reranking, adapters, and structured outputs are essential for production-grade AI systems.

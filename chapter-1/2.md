# 1.2 Fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs)

In this section, we’ll build a **strong conceptual + practical foundation** for LLMs.  
As an AI Architect, you don’t need to _train_ models from scratch, but you must understand:

- **How LLMs work internally** (so you can explain decisions).
- **Why they behave the way they do** (biases, hallucinations, limitations).
- **How to interact with them effectively** (prompting, fine-tuning, RAG).

## 🔹 1.2.1 What is an LLM?

A **Large Language Model** is a neural network trained on massive amounts of text to predict the **next word** in a sequence.

- Think of it as a **super autocomplete**, but trained on billions of tokens.
- Instead of rules, it learns **probability distributions of words/tokens**.
- Architect role: knowing _why_ it works helps you design _how_ to use it.

## 🔹 1.2.2 How LLMs Work (Simplified View)

At a high level:

1. **Tokenization** – Breaks text into chunks (words/subwords).  
   Example: `"ChatGPT rocks!"` → `["Chat", "G", "PT", "rocks", "!"]`.

2. **Embeddings** – Each token becomes a vector (mathematical representation).  
   Vectors capture meaning and context. Similar words → similar vectors.

3. **Transformer Architecture** – The backbone of modern LLMs.

   - **Attention Mechanism**: Lets the model “focus” on important words in context.
   - Parallelization makes training possible at huge scale.

4. **Prediction** – Model outputs the most probable next token.  
   Repeat this process → full sentences, paragraphs, code.

## 🔹 1.2.3 Key Concepts Every Architect Must Know

- **Parameters** → Size of the brain (GPT-3: 175B, LLaMA 3: 70B).
- **Context Window** → Max input tokens model can "see" (e.g., 4k, 32k, 1M).
- **Training vs. Inference**
  - Training = teaching the model (requires GPUs, expensive).
  - Inference = using the model (what we mostly do).
- **Hallucination** → Confidently wrong answers. Mitigation: retrieval + validation.
- **Bias** → Models reflect their training data. Architect’s job: guardrails.

## 🔹 1.2.4 Practical Hands-On Labs

Even as an architect, you need **hands-on feel** of LLMs. Here are lightweight exercises:

### Lab 1: Play with Tokenization

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
text = "AI Architecting is the future!"
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
print(tokens)

```

See how text breaks into tokens.

Architect’s insight: This affects context window and cost (LLMs charge per token).

**Lab 2: Use OpenAI API (or HuggingFace)**

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key="your-key")

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4o-mini",
messages=[
{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI architect assistant."},
{"role": "user", "content": "Explain transformers in 3 bullet points."}
]
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

This is how LLMs are integrated into apps.

Architect’s role: decide system messages, user flow, safety constraints.

👉 If you don’t want to use paid APIs:

Try HuggingFace Inference API → https://huggingface.co/models

Run free models locally with transformers library.

**Lab 3: Observe Hallucinations**

Ask the model:
"Who won the 2025 FIFA World Cup?" (Answer may be wrong if it doesn’t have data).

Architect’s job: detect when RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is required.

**🔹 1.2.5 Why This Matters for AI Architects**

- You’ll design pipelines, not train models.
- Knowing how LLMs break text down → helps plan RAG pipelines efficiently.
- Knowing hallucinations & bias → helps decide when to use external verification.
- Knowing context windows & costs → critical for budgeting and scaling apps.

✅ Checkpoint for You

**Can you explain to a teammate:**

- What’s a token?
- What’s a context window?
- Why do LLMs hallucinate?

- If yes → you’re ready for the next section.

- If not → revisit The Illustrated Transformer → https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/.
